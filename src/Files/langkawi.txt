It is amazing. I had always wanted to go paragliding, and when I finally went I couldn't believe how amazing it is.
It's honestly like flying! I personally had almost no adrenaline; it's really not that scary. But the view!
I could see for miles! Everybody was so far below me. 
It was also better than an airplane for me because I could feel the wind on my skin and I wasn't confined to a window for viewing purposes. 
If you like rollercoasters and aren't afraid of heights, I would definitely recommend it
